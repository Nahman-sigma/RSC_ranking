**Yoooo <3**

**This contains my scripts from 2 seperate mini projects (the box one was at the request of a game owner): box selling system and sharingan simulation**

- The scripts for the box selling are: Leaderstats.lua , JobHandler.lua and Handler.lua

- The scripts for my sharingan simulation are: Activaiton.lua and ServerScript.lua


I'm very much a beginner I know the scripts are a pain to read ðŸ˜­
